# Trace Dataset Overview

This folder contains the preprocessed side-channel traces used in our paper:
**Zero-Shot Model Extraction Across Heterogeneous Devices Using Side-Channel Translation and Foundation Models**

### Device Subfolders

Each folder contains:
- Preprocessed traces (`.csv`): each row = one timestep or kernel event
- Matching label files (optional) if layer types are available
